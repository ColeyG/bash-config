# Bash Config

This is my repository to house my configuration for bash aliases and other bash stuff. It's 100% self-updating and easy to install. This can be hooked into by invoking the setup.sh script at wherever your `.bashrc` file is.

`git clone https://github.com/ColeyG/bash-config.git; sudo bash ~/bash-config/setup.sh; source ~/.bashrc`
